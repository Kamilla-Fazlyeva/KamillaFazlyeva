Test layer /src/test/java/hw4/ex1
           /src/test/java/hw4/ex2
Business layer ? (part of test package)
Core layer /src/test/java/hw4/base
           /src/main/java/hw4/pages
           /src/main/java/hw4/composite
           src/main/java/hw4/builder

Test layer is implemented and located separately in the distinct package, but test hw6.steps maybe take out to another
package in one java class. That would be part of the business layer.
The core layer, including loading the driver, description of pages, are fully implemented.
Configuration data (username and password) are stored in the property file.
Test data are fed to test cases trough the data provider.
